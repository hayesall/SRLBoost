 * Literal and terms often play a similar role.  Literals are the arguments
 * of Clauses while Terms are the arguments of Functions.  Literals are easily
 * representable as Term via a Function.  Terms are representable as Literals
 * via either the TermAsSentence class or as a more direct translation from
 * a Function to a Literal.
